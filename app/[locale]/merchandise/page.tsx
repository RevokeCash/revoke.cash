      <p>
        We believe in sustainability, which is why we do not want to produce merchandise that will end up in landfills.
        Instead, we are producing limited runs of high-quality Revoke.cash merchandise. Doing so, we want to produce
        something that can be worn every day and is not overly recognizable as crypto merch.

        Since these are limited runs, we will only be giving these out to our users at crypto events that we attend. Our
        inaugural collection is a run of 100 high-quality Revoke t-shirts that will be given out at Devcon 7 in Bangkok,
        Thailand.
      </p>

      <h2>Claiming Your T-shirt at Devcon 7</h2>

      <p>
        Leading up to Devcon 7 we are generating unique codes for our users. These codes are given to users who use our
        new Batch Revoke functionality. After completing your batch revoke, you will receive a unique code that you can
        use to claim your t-shirt in person from the Revoke team at the event.

        We will be wearing our identifiable Revoke team clothing at the event, so if you see us and have a code to
        claim, please come and say hi!
      </p>

      <h2>Future Merchandise</h2>

      <p>
        We don't have concrete plans for future merchandise, but we will update this page and announce on our social
        media when we do. Similar to the first edition, we will be giving them out at events that we attend, and they
        will have a claim code process linked to usage of our product. Let us know if you have anything on your wishlist
        for future merch!
