This page contains a list of marketplaces and a list of your tokens that support offchain <i>Permit</i> signatures. <b>Only if <i>you</i> know that you signed an offchain signature on a scam website, you need to cancel the <i>potential</i> signatures on this page</b>, otherwise you are wasting transaction fees.
