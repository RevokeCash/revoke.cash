    "taiko": "Taiko is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that is currently being built using the innovative zkEVM technology. zkEVM technology offers higher throughputs at lower costs than many other L2 solutions, while maintaining strong security guarantees compared to other L2 solutions like Optimistic Rollups.",
    "vana": "Vana is a Layer 1 blockchain that is focused ono building infrastructure for user-owned data. It does so by creating so-called DataDAOs, which are like big pools where users can contribute their data and earn rewards. Sharing data also grants users decision power over the governance of the network.",
    "velas": "Velas is a Layer 1 blockchain that aims to provide a very high throughput and low fees. To achieve this they have taken inspiration from Solana's architecture and amended it to support EVM based smart contracts. Velas uses a consensus mechanism based on Delegated Proof of Stake.",
    "viction": "Viction is a Layer 1 blockchain using a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Its design is based on having a network of separate \"app chains\", anchored by a common settlement on the Viction base chain.",
    "wanchain": "WanChain is a Layer 1 blockchain with a consensus mechanism called Galaxy Consensus, which is based on Cardano's Ouroboros algorithm. Wanchain is mainly focused on cross-chain interoperability and provides native bridges between both EVM and non-EVM networks. Wanchain secures these bridges by using techniques such as Secure Multi Party Computation.",
    "wemix": "WEMIX is a Layer 1 blockchain using a consensus mechanism they call Stake-based Proof of Authority, a mechanism with 40 validators that combines features of Proof of Stake and Proof of Authority. WEMIX has a number of official applications deployed on the chain, including an official stablecoin and gaming platform.",
    "world-chain": "World Chain is an Layer 2 blockchain built around the World Coin ecosystem. It provides free gas fees for all humans verified on the World Coin platform. World Chain is built on Optimism's Open Source OP Stack, so just like Optimism it uses optimistic rollup technology.",
    "x-layer": "X Layer is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that was developed by popular exchange OKX. X Layer was built using Polygon's Chain Development Kit (CDK) and is using zkEVM technology. Being created by OKX, the network is also designed to integrate with OKX' other products such as the OKB token.",
    "xdc": "XDC is a Layer 1 blockchain with a consensus mechanism based on Delegated Proof of Stake. It is focused on providing fast and low-cost transactions for the tokenization of real-world assets and enterprise use cases.",
    "zero": "ZERϴ is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to completely eliminate gas costs for users. It is built using zkSync's ZK Stack and features native account abstraction. Using this native account abstraction, ZERϴ is able to offer a \"zero\" gas fee for all transactions.",
    "zetachain": "ZetaChain is a Layer 1 blockchain with a consensus mechanism based on Proof of Stake that is currently in development. It aims to provide infrastructure for developers to build cross-chain applications connecting to other EVM chains and non-EVM chains alike.",
    "zircuit": "Zircuit is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that is built on zk rollup technology. To focus on security, Zircuit uses AI to monitor the network's mempool for malicious transactions and blocks them before they are included in the chain.",
    "zkfair": "ZKFair is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that is built using Polygon's Chain Development Kit (CDK) and Celestia's Data Availability layer. As the name suggests, ZKFair places an emphasis on \"fairness\" and aims to create an ecosystem in which users of the network share in the rewards of the network that usually would go to its operators.",
    "zklink-nova": "zkLink Nova is a Layer 3 blockchain built on top of Ethereum and several Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains. It aims to tackle the problem of fragmented liquidity across different Layer 2 chains by providing bridges from these other blockchains onto zkLink Nova.",
    "zksync-era": "zkSync Era is a Layer 2 scaling solution and one of the first projects to use the novel zkEVM technology. This technology offers very low fees while maintaining strong security guarantees through the use of zero-knowledge proofs. zkSync previously created zkSync Lite, which was an early version of zkRollup technology that was not yet EVM compatible. zkSync Era is the next iteration, adding full EVM support.",
    "zora": "Zora Network is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is built on Optimism's Open Source OP Stack, so just like Optimism it uses optimistic rollup technology. Since Zora Network is developed by the Zora NFT exchange its main use case lies in minting and trading NFTs."
