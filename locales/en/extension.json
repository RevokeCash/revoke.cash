  "paragraph_1": "In many cases, phishing websites try to make you sign an approval while they pretend to be an NFT mint or other legitimate use cases. When these phishing scams happen, it is recommended to use Revoke.cash to mitigate the damage, but it is even better to prevent the scam in the first place.",
  "paragraph_2": "This is where the Revoke.cash Browser Extension comes in. The extension pops up whenever you are about to sign an approval and will inform you of the approval details. This can help you prevent signing malicious approvals.",
  "paragraph_3": "The extension also informs you when you are about to list an item for sale on popular marketplaces such as OpenSea and LooksRare, or when you are about to sign a hash. These hashes are used by certain marketplaces like X2Y2 for listing NFTs.",
  "paragraph_4": "A common scam is to try to trick you into signing one of these gasless signatures on a phishing website, allowing the scammers to steal your NFTs. The official websites of OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2, Uniswap and Blur are allowlisted for these actions, so that the Revoke.cash browser extension does not interrupt your normal flow.",
  "paragraph_5": "The different categories of warnings can be turned on and off in the extension settings.",
  "paragraph_6": "The Revoke.cash browser extension works with every EVM-based network including Ethereum, Polygon and Avalanche.",
