# What Is Pig Butchering?

Most people get into crypto for one reason: To make money. But there's a scam out there designed to take all of it from you. It's called **Pig Butchering**, and it is one of the most emotionally manipulative attacks in the crypto space today. In this article, we'll break down how this notorious crypto scam works, how to spot the signs early, and how to protect yourself and others from falling victim.

Pig butchering is not your average phishing attack. Scammers don't ask for your keys up front. They play the long game. They start by building a connection. This often happens in DMs, dating apps, or groupchats. It might seem like an innocent friendship or even a romance. As time goes by, they are building trust. They listen. They encourage. They play the role perfectly.

## How the Scam Plays Out

Once the scammer feels they've built enough trust, they will give you the hook:

**"You should check out this great investment platform that I'm using."**

They walk you through it. They show you their results. You make a small deposit and see fake profits. It looks legitimate. Almost too good to be true. So you invest more and more. Until they ghost you one day. Or worse, they threaten or blackmail you into sending more money to "get your investment back." By that point, the damage is done.

And that is why it's called *Pig Butchering*. It refers to scammers "feeding" their victims with fake trust, fake profits, and fake friendship before the final drain. Everything was fake: the platform, the profits, the person. It's not a technical attack but an emotional one. It's weeks of grooming - all to steal your assets.

## How to Stay Safe

The good news? You don't need to be technically skilled to avoid pig butchering. You just need to be mindful.

- 🚫 Be wary of strangers offering investment advice
- 🚫 Never trust a platform you cannot verify independently.
- 🚫 Don't rush into financial decisions, no matter how convincing someone seems.
- 🚫 If it sounds too good to be true - it probably is.

Most importantly:
- ✅ Talk to trusted people before making big investment decisions.
- ✅ Don't isolate yourself if something feels off.

Victims of pig butchering scams often blame themselves. However, this scam is built on emotional manipulation - not carelessness. It's one of the most calculated types of social engineering. Scammers use urgency, trust, and psychology to get your guard down before the final drain. Recognizing the signs can help you protect yourself and those around you.

## TL;DR

- Pig butchering scams build **fake relationships** to manipulate you over time
- The scammer recommends a **fake platform** and encourages you to invest
- When you're fully invested, **they disappear** or blackmail you for more money
- This is **emotional and financial abuse**, not a simple mistake
- Awareness is your **best defense**
