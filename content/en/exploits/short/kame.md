Malicious actors were able to exploit a vulnerability in the smart contracts of Kame Aggregator, a DEX aggregator on Sui. Over $1.3m was stolen from users that had active token approvals to Kame Aggregator. The primary exploiter has returned the exploited funds, but in the end about $360k was stolen by secondary exploiters. The Kame team has released a compensation plan for the affected users, reimbursing the losses in full.
