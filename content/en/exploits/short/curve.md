Over $500k was stolen from users of the popular DEX Curve. Hackers were able to compromise their official website and inject malicious code into it. They injected malicious approval transactions into the frontend, draining users' wallets. Anyone that interacted with the Curve frontend on the 9th of August is at risk.
