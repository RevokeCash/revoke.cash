About $100k was rescued from a vulnerable contract of Unagii, an Ethereum DeFi yield aggregator. The funds were rescued from the vulnerable contract by the Unagii team, but close to $60k was still taken from a single user by an automated MEV operator. The Unagii team has since reimbursed all the affected users.
