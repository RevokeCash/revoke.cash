About $20k was stolen from users of Merkle Trade, a perp DEX on multiple networks. After discovering the vulnerability in their newer EVM Swap & Deposit smart contract, Merkle Trade rolled back their service to an older smart contract. Only users that have interacted with Merkle's new Swap & Deposit functionality on EVM chains since the 18th of April were affected.
