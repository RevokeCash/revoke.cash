Around $600k was stolen from users of LI.FI, a cross-chain bridge and DEX aggregator. Hackers exploited a vulnerability that allowed them to execute arbitrary functions from the context of the smart contract, including transactions that drained approved user funds. LI.FI has since then patched the vulnerability and reimbursed affected users.
