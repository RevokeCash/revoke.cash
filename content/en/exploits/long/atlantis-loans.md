Atlantis Loans was the target of a governance attack on the 11th of June 2023. The project was a lending protocol on BNB Chain that was abandon earlier in 2023. As a result of the project being abandoned the attackers were able to create a malicious governance proposal that updated several contracts in the Atlantis Loans system.

Since the project was abandoned, there were no user deposits left in the system, but there were still many users that had active approvals granted to the Atlnatis Loans smart conracts. The attackers were able to drain over $2.5M from these users by using the updated smart contracts to drain the approved funds.
