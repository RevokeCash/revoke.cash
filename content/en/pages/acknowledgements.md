# Acknowledgements

Revoke.cash is a free and open-source public good. Our mission to provide essential web3 security tools is made possible through funding from leading organizations, data partnerships, and robust technical infrastructure. This page recognizes the people and organisations that enable our work.

## Funding

As a public good, we don't charge users - making external funding essential to our sustainability and impact. Without the funding we receive from larger organisations, we would not be able to continue to provide our services for free.

Additionally, we are grateful for direct donations from community members who value our work and support the continued development of free security tools for the web3 community.

## Data Sources

Reliable blockchain data powers every feature of Revoke.cash, from understanding approvals to flagging risks. We need real-time transaction data, smart contract information and security intelligence to help users understand their token approvals and identify potential risks. This critical data comes from a combination of generous free partnerships and paid services.
