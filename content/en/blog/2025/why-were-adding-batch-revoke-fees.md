# Why We're Adding Batch Revoke Fees

Hi, I'm Rosco, the founder of Revoke.cash. Since 2019, Revoke.cash has helped millions of users stay safe, preventing over $140 million in losses from smart contract hacks alone. For years, we’ve relied entirely on grants and donations to keep the platform free and open source. As the crypto ecosystem shifted and funding for public goods declined, this model became unsustainable. To ensure we can keep improving and growing Revoke.cash for everyone, we’re introducing a small batch revoke fee.

## Revoke.cash as a Public Good

Revoke.cash was founded with the belief that proper security tools should be accessible to everyone. That is why it has been open source and free since day one. This belief has guided us ever since, and we've been able to provide our services to millions of users for free.

To support the continued development of Revoke.cash, as well as rising infrastructure costs, we've always relied on public goods funding initiatives, such as Optimism's Retro Funding, Gitcoin Grants and Octant. Over the past year, however, the crypto space has seen a significant decline in grants and public goods funding.

## Introducing Batch Revoke Fees

As a small business, we need a sustainable model to keep offering our services to users. That’s why we’re introducing a small batch revoke fee. Revoking approvals one by one will remain free, but if you want to save time and gas by batching, you’ll now pay a fee of $1.50 per batch.

This fee will help us be sustainable as a company and continue to offer you the best security services. This will allow us to keep our services running, develop important new features, like the new History tab and Delegations tab, and continue producing quality educational content.

## Fee Sponsorship

We believe that it is important for blockchain companies to support the public goods that they rely on and to keep their users safe. That is why we're offering blockchains the option to sponsor the batch revoke fee for their users. Currently, [**Optimism**](https://www.optimism.io/) is sponsoring batch revoke fees for their users, and we’re looking to add more sponsored networks in the future.

If you are a blockchain network or foundation and you want to sponsor the batch revoke fee for your users, please reach out to us at [rosco@revoke.cash](mailto:rosco@revoke.cash).

## Future of Revoke.cash

Revoke.cash has been keeping users safe for the past six years, and we’re proud of what we’ve built together. This new model will ensure we can keep core security tools free for everyone, while building even more powerful features for the ecosystem.

Thank you for your continued support and we’re excited about what’s next.

Rosco
