# Quarterly Update: Q3 2025

Q3 included a mix of product updates, new integrations, community work and network support. The main highlights were our collaboration with Pudgy Penguins, improvements across the website, and our presence at EthCC in Cannes.

## Pudgy Penguins x Revoke.cash: Cold Storage SBT

We partnered with Pudgy Penguins to create a **Cold Storage SBT**, a non-transferable Soulbound Token that users can claim when they store their assets in a cold wallet.
The goal of the SBT is to encourage safer storage practices and to give users a simple way to prove that they are following good wallet-security habits.

Pudgy Penguins is one of the biggest and most security-focused communities in the crypto space, and we're proud to partner with them to help reward users for understanding the value of cold storage.

## Improvements All Around

This quarter we shipped a range of smaller updates and improvements across the site.

- Added EIP7702 delegations to the Delegations tab
- Published an article about EIP7702 to address some common misconceptions
- Added more sorting and filtering options to the approvals dashboard
- Improved ENS resolution to resolve DNS-based names

These upgrades make it easier to inspect permissions, understand delegations and navigate the interface.

## Revoke.cash Team at EthCC

Our team attended **EthCC in Cannes**, where we met with developers, researchers and ecosystem partners. We used the event to gather feedback on upcoming features and to discuss recent changes such as EIP7702, delegations dashboard and new security integrations.

Events like EthCC help us align Revoke.cash with the needs of our users and are a great avenue to provide education and support to the community.

## New Exploits

Several new exploits occurred this quarter. We added each one to our [exploits section](/exploits), along with tools to check approvals related to the affected platforms.
