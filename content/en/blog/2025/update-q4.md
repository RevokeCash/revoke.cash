# Quarterly Update: Q4 2025

In the fourth quarter of 2025, we added some much awaited features and made a bunch of internal improvements to Revoke.cash. At the same time, we had to face the reality of public goods funding and the challenges of sustaining a public good project.

## Monetisation & Sustainability

In its six-year history, Revoke.cash has always been a free and open source public good, fully funded by grants, donations and other public goods funding initiatives. However, across the crypto ecosystem, we have noticed a significant decline in public goods funding and it has become impossible to sustain our project without a sustainable funding model.

To address this, we have started to explore new monetisation models to find a new way to sustain our project. While this means that we have to start charging our users for some features, our philosophy is unchanged: Revoke.cash remains a free and open source public good. All of the core security tools will remain fully free to use, while additional convenience features will be available for a fee.

To start this monetisation model, we have introduced a batch revoke fee. This fee is a small one-time fee that you pay when you batch revoke your approvals. You can always revoke the approvals one by one for free, but if you want to save time by batching, you'll now pay a fee of $1.50 per batch.

This helps us to cover the costs of running the service and to continue developing new features and improving the user experience. Our plan is to expand this monetisation model to include more paid features in the future, while still keeping the core security tools free to use.

## History Tab

On Revoke.cash you have always been able to see the current state of your approvals, but in order to understand *how* and *when* these approvals were granted, we have now added a new **History** tab.

On the history tab you can see a list of every approve and revoke action that your wallet has performed. This can be very useful when you're the victim of a scam or a hack, as it allows you to see exactly how and when your approvals were granted.

## Revoke.cash Team at Devconnect

Our team attended **Devconnect**, where we met with our ecosystem partners, users, and the broader crypto community. We had the chance to connect with a lot of people in the crypto space and to share our vision for Revoke.cash. We tried to get in touch with people from different blockchains to try to secure more funding, but unfortunately this did not lead to any results.

## New Exploits

Several new exploits occurred this quarter. We added each one to our [exploits section](/exploits), along with tools to check approvals related to the affected platforms.

- [402bridge Hack / Rug Pull](/exploits/402bridge)
- [Thirdweb Bridge Hack](/exploits/thirdweb)

If you interacted with any of these projects, we recommend reviewing your approvals.

## New Supported Networks

We added several new networks to our list of more than 100 supported chains.

- [Monad](/token-approval-checker/monad)
- [Swellchain](/token-approval-checker/swellchain)
- [Bittensor EVM](/token-approval-checker/bittensor-evm)
- [Injective](/token-approval-checker/injective)
