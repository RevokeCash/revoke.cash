# Revoke.cash x Pudgy Penguins: Cold Storage SBT

It is important to use a cold wallet to store your crypto assets. To help users understand the importance of cold storage, we've partnered with Pudgy Penguins to create a Cold Storage SBT. Pudgy Penguins is one of the most security-focused communities in the crypto space, and we're proud to partner with them to help reward users for understanding the value of cold storage.

## Why Cold Storage Matters

When you connect your wallet to apps, sign transactions, or give token approvals, you‚Äôre exposing your assets to risk. Hot wallets are convenient but always online, and therefore vulnerable to phishing sites, malware, and scams.

Cold storage is the opposite: your private keys are kept offline, ideally on a hardware device, and never exposed to risky interactions. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs the gold standard for storing high-value NFTs and tokens long term.

By moving your most valuable assets to cold storage, and keeping only what you actively use in your hot or warm wallets, you dramatically reduce your chances of losing everything to a single mistake.

## How to Get the Cold Storage SBT

To celebrate this partnership, we‚Äôve created a **Cold Storage Soulbound Token (SBT)** together with Pudgy Penguins. This free, non-transferable NFT is a badge of honor that shows you understand the importance of securing your assets.

Here‚Äôs how to claim it:

1. **Move your Pudgy Penguin NFT into a cold wallet.**
   This should be a hardware wallet or another wallet that you don‚Äôt use for approvals or day-to-day transactions.

2. **Verify through Revoke.cash.**
   Enter your cold wallet address, and Revoke.cash will check that you don't have any active token approvals.

3. **Pass the quiz.**
   Once you've verified your wallet, you'll be able to pass the quiz. The quiz is a simple security quiz that will help you understand the importance of cold storage.

4. **Mint your Cold Storage SBT.**
   Once you've passed the quiz, you‚Äôll be able to mint the SBT directly to the same cold wallet. Because it‚Äôs soulbound, it can‚Äôt be transferred or sold, it‚Äôs permanently tied to your wallet.

## What This Means for the Community

The Cold Storage SBT is more than a collectible. It‚Äôs a signal that you care about the long-term safety of your assets and that you‚Äôre part of a security-first movement in web3.

We believe that security education should be fun and rewarding, and by working with Pudgy Penguins we‚Äôre making cold storage not just best practice but also part of your identity as a responsible community member.
